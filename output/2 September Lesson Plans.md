## Aquifer Investigation
Students will conduct a hands-on experiment to understand the concept of an aquifer, exploring how water is stored underground and its importance in providing water to wells and springs.

### Time estimate: 60 minutes

### Materials
- Plastic cups
- Sand
- Gravel
- Water
- Plastic wrap
- Rubber bands
- Markers
- Paper
- Pencils

### Procedure
1. Start by discussing with the students what they know about water and where it comes from.
2. Introduce the concept of an aquifer as an underground layer of rock or sediment that holds water.
3. Explain the importance of aquifers in providing water to wells and springs.
4. Divide the students into small groups and provide each group with a plastic cup.
5. Instruct the students to fill the cup halfway with sand to represent the underground layer.
6. Have the students add a layer of gravel on top of the sand to simulate the rocks and sediment.
7. Pour water slowly into the cup, allowing it to seep through the sand and gravel layers.
8. Cover the cup with plastic wrap and secure it with rubber bands to represent the impermeable layer on top of the aquifer.
9. Ask the students to make predictions about what will happen when they try to extract the water from the cup.
10. Give each group a marker, paper, and pencil.
11. Instruct the students to draw and label their observations of the water extraction process.
12. Discuss the results as a class and ask the students to explain their findings.
13. Summarize the lesson by emphasizing the importance of aquifers in providing water for human use.
14. Encourage the students to think about ways they can conserve water and protect aquifers.

### Additional notes
- During the experiment, encourage the students to ask questions and make observations.
- Provide guidance and support as needed.
- After the experiment, facilitate a class discussion to reinforce key concepts.
- Consider incorporating real-life examples of aquifers in your discussion.
- You can also show pictures or videos of aquifers to enhance understanding.
- For students who need more support, provide visual aids or simplified explanations.
- For students who need more challenge, encourage them to research and present additional information about aquifers.
- For neurodivergent students, offer alternative ways to participate, such as drawing or writing instead of verbal explanations.
