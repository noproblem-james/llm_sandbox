## Gratitude Circle
In this activity, students will sit in a circle and take turns sharing something they are grateful for. This will help develop their listening and speaking skills as they actively listen to their peers and express their own gratitude.

### Time estimate: 20 minutes

### Materials
- 

### Procedure
1. Gather the students in a circle on the floor or in chairs.
2. Explain to the students that today they will be participating in a gratitude circle.
3. Model the activity by starting with your own gratitude statement. For example, 'I am grateful for my family because they always support me.'
4. Pass a small object, such as a stuffed animal or a ball, to the student on your right and instruct them to share something they are grateful for.
5. Encourage the students to actively listen to their peers and show appreciation by nodding or clapping after each gratitude statement.
6. Continue passing the object around the circle, allowing each student to share their gratitude statement.
7. If a student is struggling to come up with something they are grateful for, provide prompts or examples to help them.
8. After each student has had a turn, conclude the activity by discussing how expressing gratitude can make us feel happier and more connected to others.
9. Ask the students to reflect on the activity by writing or drawing about one thing they are grateful for.

### Additional notes
- This activity can be done as a daily or weekly routine to foster a positive and grateful classroom environment.
- Encourage students to use descriptive language and provide specific details when expressing their gratitude.
- This activity can be modified for neurodivergent students by allowing them to express their gratitude in a way that is comfortable for them, such as drawing or using visual aids.
- For phonics and literacy development, have students practice writing their gratitude statements using proper spelling and punctuation.
- For numeracy development, have students keep track of the number of gratitude statements shared during each circle and create a graph or chart to represent the data.

### Differentiation strategies
- For students who need additional challenge, encourage them to think of multiple things they are grateful for and share them in a single turn.
- For students who need additional support, provide sentence starters or sentence frames to help them structure their gratitude statements.
- For neurodivergent students, allow them to express their gratitude in alternative ways, such as through art or using assistive technology.

## Gratitude Journal

3. 3. Distribute the blank notebooks or paper to each student.
4. 4. Encourage the students to decorate the covers of their journals using pencils, markers, stickers, or other decorative materials.
5. 5. Instruct the students to write the title 'Gratitude Journal' on the cover of their notebooks.
6. 6. Have the students number the pages of their journals from 1 to 10 (or more, depending on the number of pages available).
7. 7. Explain that each day, they will write or draw something they are grateful for on a new page of their journal.
8. 8. Provide some prompts to help them get started, such as 'What made you smile today?' or 'Who are you thankful for?'
9. 9. Give the students time to work on their journals. Circulate around the room to provide assistance and guidance as needed.
10. 10. Once the students have completed their first entry, gather them together for a reflection discussion.
11. 11. Ask volunteers to share what they wrote or drew in their journals and why they chose that particular thing to be grateful for.
12. 12. Discuss the importance of expressing gratitude and how it can positively impact our mindset and relationships.
13. 13. Encourage the students to continue using their gratitude journals on a regular basis, either at school or at home.
14. 14. Collect the journals at the end of the lesson to keep them safe until the next time they are used.

### Additional notes
- - This activity can be modified for neurodivergent students by allowing them to use alternative methods of expression, such as dictating their thoughts to a teacher or using visual aids instead of writing.
- - For students who struggle with writing, encourage them to draw pictures or use stickers to represent things they are grateful for.
- - To incorporate phonics and literacy development, have the students practice writing the words 'gratitude' and 'journal' on the cover of their notebooks.
